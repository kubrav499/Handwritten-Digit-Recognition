# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Dataset

This project develops a model to recognize handwritten digits using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The MNIST dataset is used in this project. It contains handwritten digits along with their correct labels.

## Data Preprocessing

Data is normalized to scale pixel values between 0 and 1.

## Model Development

A deep learning model is employed in this project. The model is constructed in layers and trained using the ReLU activation function.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
